In this post, we will compare the most popular AI tools (frontier models and AI assistants) based on its capabilities, limitations and how I found them useful in my day-to-day use. 

There are multiple models to look at and multiple dimensions for each model. So they are represented as mind maps in three sections:
1. **Language models** - the most popular text-based models that are used for text-to-text content generation.
2. **AI assistants** - the chatbots that use one or more of the above models.
3. **Other models** - other models that are used for text-to-image, text-to-voice or text-to-video use cases.

At the end, we will also see the common set of tasks that we try to accomplish using these LLMs and recommendations on which tool is best for each task.

Note - this is not an exhaustive list, just the tools that I have explored and used. Also, these tools are constantly evolving, so this comparison is relevant at this point in time and will change very soon.

## Best tools for the common tasks
The table below shows the common tasks that we try to do using the AI tools, suggestions on which tools are best for those tasks and my individual preference (the tool that I use personally).
