Hi, I‚Äôm **Ann Catherine Jose** ‚Äî a hands-on tech enthusiast, software builder, and full-stack developer who loves to learn, create, and explore. I have a passion for technology, math, music and building meaningful things for others. I believe in improving myself and the world around me a little each day. *Be the change you want to see*.

For over 20 years, I‚Äôve been part of the software industry, taking on roles from developer to engineering leader. At Intuit, I led the QuickBooks Platform and Mobile teams, where we built tools that helped millions of small business owners and self-employed individuals thrive. My work spanned everything from creating mobile apps to developing the infrastructure behind QuickBooks Online. Toward the end of my time there, I also explored exciting new areas like generative AI, blending cutting-edge technology with practical solutions to make customers‚Äô lives easier.

In October 2023, I decided to pivot my career to focus on learning and building again. I wanted to rediscover the joy of creating with my own hands, diving deep into the technical challenges that inspired me at the start of my journey. I‚Äôve also rekindled my love for mathematics, exploring its beauty and connection to problem-solving. This phase of my life is all about combining what I know with what I‚Äôm learning to build something truly valuable.

**At my core, I am a builder.** 
Whether it‚Äôs writing code, solving a tricky problem, or crafting scalable systems, I‚Äôve always loved building things from the ground up. As a leader, I made sure to create an environment where teams felt empowered to innovate and grow, prioritizing creativity and collaboration. I'm an engineer who thrives on being hands-on. I find extreme joy in coding and building for hours and hours - being in the flow. 

**I am really good at** modern web technologies like **Next.js**, **React**, **Tailwind**, **TypeScript**, and advanced **JavaScript**, with the ability to build fully functional modern web applications in just a few hours. I have also worked extensively on mobile technologies like **iOS**, **Android**, **iOS**, and **Swift** and **Kotlin**.

I thrive in learning something new every day. Currently, I am **expanding my skills** by learning **SQLite**, **Astro**, and **Graph Databases** to explore new ways of building and managing data-driven applications.

#### Beyond Technology
Outside of technology, two areas of passion for me are Math and Music. They are creative outlets that complemens my technical side and keeps me inspired. I am learning Math from Math Academy and MIT OCW and learning piano at home. I also enjoy sharing what I learn on my blog, [Reflections](https://annjose.com/). I write about my experiences with technology, math, and the journey of building things that matter.
