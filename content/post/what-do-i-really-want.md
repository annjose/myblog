The other day I watched a TED video where the presenter urged the audience to ask the question **What do you really want?** That got me thinking what do **I** really want. It is an interesting question to ask myself, since I have tried different roles and responsibilites - broad and deep - in the last couple of years.  

So I was pleasantly surprised when I found the book [Data Structures and Algorithms in C++](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Adam-Drozdek-dp-1133608426/dp/1133608426) by Adam Drozdek on my bookshelf. The book is full of code and exercises in C++, a language which I haven't used in a while. 

Getting started with this book and playing around with the code helped me realize that I found my happy place. I love love love sitting in front of the computer, learning something new, trying out some code, going down the rabbit hole of troubleshooting, breaking my head over why-it-is-not-working, and finally enjoying the sense of satisfaction when it works! I figured this is the perfect time to go down that rabbit hole since I am taking a week-long break from work. So without any delay, I started the journey to the happy place.

I am capturing my notes using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a powerful tool to create a knowledge base using simple markdown files that can be hosted locally or in a github repo. My Obsidian notes for this book are available at my github repo [Book Learnings](https://github.com/annjose/book-learnings).
