The other day I watched a TED video where the presenter urged the audience to ask the question **What do you really want?** That got me thinking what do **I** really want. It is an interesting question to ask myself, since I have tried different roles and responsibilites - broad and deep - in the last couple of years.  

So I was pleasantly surprised when I found the book [Data Structures and Algorithms in C++](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Adam-Drozdek-dp-1133608426/dp/1133608426) by Adam Drozdek on my shelf. The book is full of code and exercises in C++, a language which I haven't used in a while. 

Getting started with this book and playing around with the code helped me realize that I found my happy place. I love love sitting in front of the computer, trying out something new, going down the rabbit hole of troubleshooting, breaking my head over problems, and finally that sense satisfaction when the solution *clicks*. I realized that this is the perfect opportunity to go down that rabbit hole since especially since I am taking a week-long break from work.

I am going to capture my notes using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a powerful tool to create a knowledge base from any folder or in my case, the github repo [Book Learnings](https://github.com/annjose/book-learnings)
