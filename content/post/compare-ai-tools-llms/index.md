In this post, we will compare the most popular AI tools (frontier models and AI assistants) based on its capabilities, limitations and my personal experience of using them day-to-day. 

In order to accomodate the multiple dimensions of each model, this comparison is represented as mind maps in three parts:
1. **Language models** - the most popular text-based models that are used for text-to-text content generation.
2. **AI assistants** - the chatbots that are powered by one or more of the above models.
3. **Other models** - other models that are used for text-to-image, text-to-voice or text-to-video use cases.

At the end, we will also see the common set of tasks that we try to accomplish using these tools and recommendations on which tool is best for each task.

Note - this is not an exhaustive list, just the tools that I have explored and used. Also, these tools are constantly evolving, so this comparison is relevant at this point in time and will change very soon.

## Best tools for the common tasks
The table below shows the common tasks that can be done using the AI tools, specifically available through an AI assisant. I give suggestions on which tools are best for each task and my own preference of the tool that I use personally.
