The User Interface is going beyond UI and voice recognition to the new trend of using conversation as a new way to engage with customers, i.e. **Conversation As Interface**. It is a more natural form of communication, especially for question-answer / interview experiences.

Now there is an emerging trend of companies opening their chat bot API to third party developers. Facebook [has been doing experiments](http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/05/facebook-messenger-bots/) in their Messenger app allowing a few developers like Uber, Assist etc. to create chat bots. They are [expected to announce](http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/07/facebook-chatbots/) opening up the SDK to all in next week’s F8 conference. Microsoft [released a Bot Framework](http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/30/microsoft-is-bringing-bots-to-skype-and-everywhere-else/) in Build last week and this supports multiple channels – Slack, SMS, Skype etc. Similarly, [Line](http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/24/line-builds-out-its-chat-app-for-businesses-as-facebook-messenger-threat-looms-large/) announced its SDK.

Chat bots could be a new way to reach customers even when the app is not installed. And if they support deep linking, then developers can deliver a smooth transition into sepcific flows in the app. This is a great opportunity to be where our users are. It will be interesting to see how this idea pans out.
