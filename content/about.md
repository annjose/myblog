Software developer skilled in iOS, Swift, ObjectiveC, ReactNative, JavaScript, C#, .NET. 

Loves to learn and experiment. 

The latest contribution has been developing TurboTax iOS app from ground up last year. Always looking for multiple ways to improve the user experience as well as tech hygeine. 

I believe that building the product right is as important as building the right product. 

I love coding @[github](https://github.com/annjose), tweet [@annjose](https://twitter.com/annjose), and connect [@LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annjose)
