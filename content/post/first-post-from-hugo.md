This is my first blog post created by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a simple, fast and powerful blogging engine written in Go. Setting up my blog on Hugo was quick and easy; it took less than 4 hours.


I have set this up such that I publish the content to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), so the publish workflow is as simple as writing some Markdown and a git push. [This is a good tutorial](http://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/) on how to do this. 

Here is what I love about Hugo:

* Static content generation, which means blazing fast rendering, no need to manage databases, VMs etc.
* Very easy to publish content - create content in markdown and simple git push
* No dependency issues; literally runs out of the box
* Highly customizable UI
* A good opportunity to learn [Go language](https://golang.org/)

So far, I am just loving Hugo. Next step is to explore it further and customize it to my heart's content.
