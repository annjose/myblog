Welcome to Week #5 review of my [remagine journey](/post/new-beginning/). The previous week's reviews and the full series can be found at [new-beginning tag collection](/tags/new-beginning/).

## What I was able to do this week

* First things first - I was able to get out of the rut from last week. if you don't know what I am talking about, see last's week review [Week #4 Review](/post/week-in-review-week4/) where it was rough for me in terms of motivation and learning routine. But this week was different. Phew! ‚ù£Ô∏è

* Started AND finished the Execute Program course [TypeScript Basics](https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/typescript-basics). Yes, in just 4 days - super happy! How was I able to finish it this fast - well, I think it is because TypeScript is an addition to JavaScript and also, the concepts in this course match my mental model much better than with JS (one statically typed language, and the other is JavaScript).

* I also completed 81% of the other course 'Modern JavaScript'. I think the momentum with TypeScript course helped me progress well on this course also. Momentum begets momentum.

* Did the strength workouts and walked 8K steps everyday except Monday. I found two shows on HBO - [The Investigation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9112152/), a Danish TV series and [News Week](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1870479/), an American drama series premiered in 2011. I just put it on and walk - each episode if 45-55 min long and it gives me 8K-9K steps. Good deal, no?

## What I learned this week

* Don't wait for motivation. Start now, start here. Make a plan, you will fail. That's ok, start from there. Do not give up. My motivation was night-n-day difference between week 4 and week 5. As I am typing this, I feel I am on a roll, unstoppable.

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a beautiful, well-designed language. It has not only enhanced JavaScript by resolving many of the cryptic issues, but also did it in way that ensures compatibility. Every JavaScript file is valid TypeScript file. TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.

* I have always seen TypeScript from the side rails, but this week as I learned the language from the ground up, I saw the greatness of the launguage design. It gives me so much joy that it reminds me of a famous Tamil song *Kanmani anbodu kaadhalan* where Kamal Hassan sings '*Athae thaan ‚Ä¶ ah ha ‚Ä¶ pramaatham Kavitha kavitha ‚Ä¶ padi*' (translation - '*yes, exactly that, beautiful poem, read...*').

* This week in piano class, we started learning Christmas songs - *Joy to the World*, *Christmas Toy Shop* - and I chose one personal song to learn *Santa Claus is coming to town*. I am excited about Christmas - so many sweet memories of celebrating with my parents and family.

* I practiced piano almost every day and loved it. Finally, I am also able to play Perfect song with left and right hand together. Still not smooth, but much better than last two weeks. I am also able to play the other two songs - *Joy to the World* and *Santa Claus is coming to town*.

* My GitHub activity reflects my low and high of motivation correctly. Week 1 and 2 were on fire üî•, weeks 3 was dull üêå, week 4 was almost empty ‚õî, and now week 5 is back on fire üî•!

## Looking Ahead to Next Week

#### Primary goals for next week (Week #5)
Let me keep it pretty simple here - just get back to the routine on learning.
  1. Get back to the learning routine - focus, focus, focus. 
  2. Zero distractions - home-organization, cleaning, youtube videos - all of that can wait for a while.
  3. Continue health streak - walk 9K steps every day and 3-day strength training.
  4. Learn piano songs - Perfect (both hands), Joy to the World and Santa Claus is coming to town.

#### Goals around the corner in November
* Learning all the Christmas songs at the piano class
* Finish the Modern JS course
* Silver tier in November Running Challenge too!
* Start preparing for Christmas, the best time of the year! üéÑüßë‚ÄçüéÑüéâ

I am glad that I am out of the rough spot. As always, *Learn everyday.* *Progress, not perfection!* üöÄüí™.
