This is my first blog post created by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), the fast, simple and powerful blogging engine. The best part is that I could stand up my blog with Hugo in less than 4 hours. 

I have set this up such that I publish the content to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), so the publish workflow is as simple as writing some Markdown and a git push. [This is a good tutorial](http://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/) on how to do this. 

Here is what I love about Hugo:

* Static site generator - no need of databases, runtimes, VMs etc.
* Very easy to publish content
* No dependency issues; literally runs out of the box
* Highly customizable UI
* A good opportunity to learn #golang

So far, I am just loving Hugo. Next step is to explore it further and customize it to my heart's content.
