*This post has been sitting in my draft for two weeks, waiting for my time to polish and post. But then as usual, I never got to it and it just stayed there. Anyway, now I am gonna just publish. So if you see typos or mistakes, please lmk. Progress, not perfection, yeah?*

It's time to review Week #3 of my [reimagine journey](/post/new-beginning/). The previous week's reviews and the full series be found at [new-beginning tag collection](/tags/new-beginning/).

## What I was able to do this week ✅

As usual, let' review based on the goals that were set up for the week:

1. **Complete the course *Modern JavaScript* and *Typescript* - 100% this time** 🎯. I could reached only 46% of the *Modern JavaScript* course. And the TypeScript course - I have not even started. Actually, I realized that it is not possible to finish the *Modern JavaScript* course quickly - because of the huge volume of content and it follows the spaced repetition practice that allows you to do only a pre-defined portion of the content.

2. **Improve the consistency of walking 9K steps every.single.day and do 2000m rowing three days (Tue, Thu, Sat)** 💪 - I made good progress here. Did rowing for two days - Tue and Thu. Andd I walked every.single.day. In fact, on Tuesday, I went to my piano class and to the grovery store by walking so that I will get the steps in 🚶‍♀️. It was fun (and funny) to walk around with a backpack full of lessons books, onions, carrots and beans.

3. **Continue to refine *The Flow* routine - move around >= 10 min every hour** 🚶👟. - This was slow this week, at least I could not stay focused as much as I wanted to. I followed it may be 50% of the time. 

4. **Play the song Perfect by Ed Sheeran on the piano - both hands** 🎵🎹 - I got the right hand properly (see a video below), but I |really struggled with the left hand. I just could not even understand the chords. I would continously play the keys until my hands hurt, and be frustrated. Then toda morning, out of the blue, I got it while practicing! It just clicked for me - very wierd. Now I can practice and make it bette. Yes, small success motivates you to do more.

5. **Read one book** 📚 - I started [reading a book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brown%27s_School_Days), but did not finish it. Not finding the motivation to read everyday in the midst of many things. This is also strange, but more on that below.

Note: As usual, all the code examples and exercises done this week are shared in my github repo https://github.com/annjose/learn-javascript/tree/main/execprogram-modernjs-course.

## Other things done ☑️

This week, I completed the Peloton October Running Challenge with Silver Tier- walk 25 miles in a month. Btw, the challenge is named "running", but I absolutely did not run, I just walked on the treadmill at a speed of 3.2 mph. I know, I know this is low intensity, but I walk for 45-60 min. So (I think) it is good. Plus, I get to watch Netflix/HBO while on the treadmill. Btw, I reached this level after a long time - the last time I got here was 14 months ago. So yeah, that too!

This one may sound crazy (and may also be one of the reasons why I didn't get the time to read) - I started taking [Spanish lessons in Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/enroll/es/en/Learn-Spanish). As a California resident, I was always curious about this language which was the official state administrative language until 1848. What really triggered my motivation was a recent TED talk [How to make learning as addictive as social media](https://www.ted.com/talks/luis_von_ahn_how_to_make_learning_as_addictive_as_social_media?language=en) by Luis von Ahn. 

He made a strong case than we can (and should) use the techniques and strategies used by social media companies to grab our attention to the field of learning and education. And that is exactly what he and his co-foudner did in Duolingo. And I see it in action in the  product as I am taking these lessons. They do just the right amount of gamification, healthy competition and nudges to maintain your streak. Yes, indeed it is addicitive, but is for a good cause to learn this language.

## What I learned this week 🍀

* Wearing the workout sneakers at home gives you constant reminder that you need to walk around and reach the 9K steps by end of the day. I tried it a couple of days and it really helped me, so I will continue this practice.

* I love, love, love that I am coding everyday, even though they are simple exercises and projects. When I am at the keyboard, I am in the flow.

* In Hugo, you can embed a video in any page/post using a Hugo shortcode https://github.com/martignoni/hugo-video. This was pretty cool - I thought we could embed only images. The more I learn about Hugo, the more I love it.

  Here is a video of me playing the Perfect song on my piano. This was recorded on 29 Oct to send to my teacher for review. As you can see, it is nowhere close to the real song, in fact, you may even find it hard to recognize the song as you know it. Sorry! But, you know, this is my progress at the time and I am happt to share it with you. Also,his is my best performance on the piano in my entire life. Progress over perfection, right?
