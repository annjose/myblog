+++

I'm **Ann Catherine Jose**, a software developer specialized in building full-stack web and native mobile applications. As a lifelong learner and builder, I've always loved learning different technologies and creating valuable solutions for people. 

I find joy in the immersive experience of learning and coding for hours - being *in the flow*. My expertise is in rapidly developing fully functional modern web applications using the best technologies and tools, including AI at the appropriate level.

### Professional Journey
My career spans over two decades in the software industry, with significant engineering roles at major tech companies. Prior to my last position, I held roles at [Philips](https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/our-strategy.html), [SAP](https://www.sap.com/index.html) and [Tata Infotech](https://www.tcs.com/), as individual contributor and engineering leader. These experiences laid the foundation for my technical expertise and leadership approach.

During my 12-year tenure at [Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/), I led the Engineering organization for QuickBooks Platform and Mobile. As the Head of Engineering, I collaborated closely with Product, Design, and Marketing leaders to deliver best-in-class solutions for our customers. My legacy includes driving the QuickBooks mobile strategy, completing high-risk, long-term infrastructure initiatives in QuickBooks Platform, and establishing a strong foundation for Gen AI in Intuit's Small Business group.

### Career Pivot
In 2023, I made a career pivot and embarked on a [Reimagine Journey](https://annjose.com/tags/new-beginning/) to shift my focus from engineering leadership to hands-on technology. This extended leave gave me the opportunity to reflect on my passions and shape the next chapter of my career. 

In August 2024, after an incredible 14-year journey at Intuit, I made the bittersweet decision to leave Intuit and pursue a life focusing on personal growth, learning and building tech solutions to real-life problems without the constraints of a full-time job.

### Technical Interests
I am proficient in building web applications using **modern web technologies** like Next.js, React, Tailwind, TypeScript, and advanced JavaScript.  I have also worked extensively on **mobile technologies** like iOS, Android, Swift and Kotlin. 

My GitHub profile showcases various projects and learning repositories, including explorations in JavaScript, React, and machine learning.

### Current Focus
As a hands-on tech enthusiast, I'm expanding my skills by:
* Learning SQLite, Astro, and Graph databases to build data-driven applications
* Exploring the capabilities of AI, large language models and RAG
* Building web applications and websites for personal projects and family/friends

### Beyond Technology
Outside of technology, two areas of passion for me are Math and Music. They are creative outlets that complement my technical side and keep me inspired. I'm learning Math from [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/) and [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/), as well as learning piano by myself at home.

I enjoy sharing what I learn on my blog, [Reflections](https://annjose.com/). There, I write about my experiences with technology, math, and the journey of building things that matter. 

### My Philiosophy of Life
Personally, I strive to embody the principle of "Be the Change You Want to See" and make each day better than the last. This philosophy emphasizes personal responsibility, self-reflection, and self-discipline. 

As a leader, I've always aimed to foster an environment where teams feel empowered to innovate and grow. My leadership style is to be direct, kind and firm, with an emphasis on empathy and empowerment.

###  Connect With Me
I'm always excited to engage with fellow tech enthusiasts, collaborate on interesting projects, participate in hackathons, or discuss the latest in technology.
