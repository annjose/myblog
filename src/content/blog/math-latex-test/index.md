This post is a test of LaTeX and MathJax rendering after migrating this blog from Hugo to Astro. As part of the migration I updated the math rendering pipeline, and I wanted to put it through its paces with something genuinely complex. As source material I used a transcript of GPT-5.4 Pro working through a hard combinatorics problem — the hypergraph extremal function $H(n)$ — originally posted to [Epoch AI's open problems list](https://epoch.ai/files/open-problems/gpt-5-4-pro-hypergraph-ramsey.txt) and shared on Hacker News post [Epoch confirms GPT5.4 Pro solved a frontier math open problem](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47497757). I don't claim to follow the math, but it makes for a thorough stress-test: display equations, aligned blocks, cases, tables with math symbols, inline variables, and Python code all in one post.

**USER**:

don't search the internet. 
This is a test to see how well you can craft non-trivial, novel and creative solutions given a "combinatorics" math problem. Provide a full solution to the problem.  

**Problem**:      
"A hypergraph $(V,E)$ has a *partition of size $m$* if there exist $D\subseteq V$ and $P\subseteq E$ such that $|D|=m$ and every vertex of $D$ lies in exactly one edge of $P$.
Let $H(n)$ be the maximum $|V|$ over all hypergraphs $(V,E)$ with no isolated vertices and no partition of size greater than $n$.
It is known that
$$
H(n)\ge k_n,

where  

k_1=1,\qquad
k_n=\left\lfloor \frac n2\right\rfloor + k_{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}+k_{\lfloor (n+1)/2\rfloor}.
$$
Show that for some constant $c>1$,
$
H(n)\ge c\,k_n,
$
with the improvement already valid for $n=15$ (it may fail for small $n$).
Give an algorithm that, for input $n$, outputs a hypergraph witnessing this bound.


**Output:** a Python function `solution(n: int) -> str` returning the hypergraph as a string, with vertices labeled $1,\dots,|V|$ and edges written like
$$
\texttt{\{1,2,3\},\{2,4\},\{3,4,5\}}.
$$
**Constraint:** for all $n\le 100$, the algorithm must run within 10 minutes on a typical laptop."

REMEMBER - this unconditional argument may require non-trivial, creative and novel elements.

**ASSISTANT**:

Let
$$
u_H(P):=\bigl|{v\in V:\text{$v$ lies in exactly one edge of }P}\bigr|
$$
for a hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ and $P\subseteq E$. Then $H$ has no partition larger than $n$ exactly when
$$
u_H(P)\le n\qquad\text{for every }P\subseteq E.
$$

So the problem is to build hypergraphs with many vertices but with $u_H(P)$ uniformly bounded.

## 1. A substitution lemma

It is convenient to work with a tiny “outer” hypergraph on meta-edges ${1,\dots,t}$.

Call a hypergraph $F$ on meta-edges $[t]$ an $(n_1,\dots,n_t)$-**frame** if:

1. $F$ has exactly $n_i$ singleton vertices ${i}$ on meta-edge $i$;
2. for every $T\subseteq [t]$, if $F[T]$ denotes the induced subhypergraph obtained by keeping only vertices contained in $T$, then
$$
   u_{F[T]}(Q)\le \sum_{i\in T} n_i \qquad \text{for every }Q\subseteq T.
$$

Now suppose $H_i$ is any hypergraph with no partition larger than $n_i$, for each $i$. Replace the $i$-th singleton block of the frame by the whole hypergraph $H_i$, and for every non-singleton meta-vertex $S\subseteq [t]$ of $F$, add one actual vertex lying in **all** edges of the blocks $H_i$ with $i\in S$.

This gives a new hypergraph $F(H_1,\dots,H_t)$.

### Lemma

If $F$ is an $(n_1,\dots,n_t)$-frame and each $H_i$ has no partition larger than $n_i$, then
$$
F(H_1,\dots,H_t)
$$
has no partition larger than $n_1+\cdots+n_t$.

### Proof

Take any chosen set $P$ of actual edges. Write $P_i$ for the part of $P$ inside block $H_i$.

Let
$$
T:={i: |P_i|\le 1}.
$$
If $i\notin T$, then inside $H_i$ we get at most $n_i$ uniquely-covered vertices, and any outer vertex using block $i$ cannot be uniquely covered because it already meets at least two chosen edges there. So all blocks outside $T$ contribute at most $\sum_{i\notin T}n_i$.

Inside $T$, let
$$
I:={i\in T: |P_i|=1}.
$$
The contribution from the blocks in $T$, together with all outer vertices supported inside $T$, is bounded by the exactly-once count of the frame $F[T]$ on the chosen meta-edge set $I$, hence by $\sum_{i\in T}n_i$.

So altogether
$$
u(P)\le \sum_{i\notin T}n_i+\sum_{i\in T}n_i=\sum_{i=1}^t n_i.
$$
That is exactly the claim. ∎

The union of two frames on the same meta-edge set is again a frame, with the capacities added coordinatewise, because all exactly-once counts add.

---

## 2. Two useful frames

### Binary frame

For capacities $a,b$, take meta-edges ${1,2}$, with $a$ singleton vertices on $1$, $b$ singleton vertices on $2$, and $\min(a,b)$ copies of ${1,2}$.

This is an $(a,b)$-frame, so
$$
H(a+b)\ge \min(a,b)+H(a)+H(b).
$$
Choosing $a=\lfloor n/2\rfloor$, $b=\lceil n/2\rceil$ gives the classical $k_n$-recurrence.

### Four-way frame

Now the improvement. Work on meta-edges ${1,2,3,4}$.

The core gadget $C$ is:

* one copy of every 2-subset of ${1,2,3,4}$,
* one copy of every 3-subset,
* three copies of ${1,2,3,4}$.

So $|C|=13$. A direct check shows $C$ is a $(3,3,3,3)$-frame.

For the 12 residue classes mod $12$, use the following small residual gadgets $R_t$ on ${1,2,3,4}$:

$$
\begin{array}{c|l|c}
t & R_t & |R_t|\\
\hline
0 & \varnothing & 0\\
1 & \varnothing & 0\\
2 & {34} & 1\\
3 & {234,234} & 2\\
4 & {123,124,134,234} & 4\\
5 & {123,1234,1234,1234} & 4\\
6 & {12,34,123,124,1234,1234} & 6\\
7 & {23,24,34,123,1234,1234} & 6\\
8 & {123,124,134,234}\times 2 & 8\\
9 & {12,13,23,123,124,134,234,1234,1234} & 9\\
10 & R_4\cup R_6 & 10\\
11 & R_4\cup R_7 & 10
\end{array}
$$

Each $R_t$ is a valid residual frame for the corresponding residual capacities
$$
(0,0,0,0),(0,0,0,1),(0,0,1,1),(0,1,1,1),\dots,(2,3,3,3),
$$
a finite check on the 4 meta-edges.

Hence, for $n=12q+t$, the union
$$
qC;\cup;R_t
$$
is a valid 4-way frame for the balanced 4-part split of $n$. Writing $n=4m+r$ with $0\le r\le 3$, this yields the four-part recurrence
$$
A_n\ge
\begin{cases}
4A_m + e_0(m), & r=0,\\
3A_m + A_{m+1} + e_1(m), & r=1,\\
2A_m + 2A_{m+1} + e_2(m), & r=2,\\
A_m + 3A_{m+1} + e_3(m), & r=3,
\end{cases}
$$
where
$$
e_0(m)=\Bigl\lfloor \frac{13m}{3}\Bigr\rfloor,\quad
e_1(m)=\Bigl\lfloor \frac{13m+1}{3}\Bigr\rfloor,\quad
e_2(m)=\Bigl\lfloor \frac{13m+5}{3}\Bigr\rfloor,\quad
e_3(m)=\Bigl\lfloor \frac{13m+6}{3}\Bigr\rfloor.
$$

Define $A_1=1$, and for $n\ge 2$,
$$
A_n:=\max!\left(
\left\lfloor\frac n2\right\rfloor + A_{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}+A_{\lceil n/2\rceil},
\text{ the 4-way value above}
\right).
$$
By the substitution lemma, $H(n)\ge A_n$ for every $n$.

For $n=15$, we have $15=4\cdot 3+3$, so
$$
A_{15}\ge A_3+3A_4+e_3(3)=5+3\cdot 8+15=44.
$$
Since $k_{15}=43$, the improvement already starts at $15$.

---

## 3. A constant factor $>1$

Take
$$
c:=\frac{57}{56}>1.
$$

A direct computation of the recurrence for $15\le n<60$ gives
$$
A_n\ge \frac{57}{56}k_n,
$$
and the minimum ratio in that range is attained at
$$
n=32:\qquad A_{32}=114=\frac{57}{56}\cdot 112=\frac{57}{56}k_{32}.
$$

Now let $n\ge 60$, write $n=4m+r$ with $0\le r\le 3$. Then $m,m+1\ge 15$, so by induction
$$
A_m\ge c k_m,\qquad A_{m+1}\ge c k_{m+1}.
$$

Also,
$$
\begin{aligned}
e_0(m)&=4m+\Bigl\lfloor \frac m3\Bigr\rfloor,\\
e_1(m)&=4m+\Bigl\lfloor \frac{m+1}3\Bigr\rfloor,\\
e_2(m)&=4m+1+\Bigl\lfloor \frac{m+2}3\Bigr\rfloor,\\
e_3(m)&=4m+2+\Bigl\lfloor \frac m3\Bigr\rfloor,
\end{aligned}
$$
and each floor term is much larger than the extra $1/56$-fraction needed for $c=57/56$. So
$$
e_0(m)\ge c\cdot 4m,\quad
e_1(m)\ge c\cdot 4m,\quad
e_2(m)\ge c(4m+1),\quad
e_3(m)\ge c(4m+2).
$$

Finally,
$$
\begin{aligned}
k_{4m}&=4k_m+4m,\\
k_{4m+1}&=3k_m+k_{m+1}+4m,\\
k_{4m+2}&=2k_m+2k_{m+1}+4m+1,\\
k_{4m+3}&=k_m+3k_{m+1}+4m+2.
\end{aligned}
$$
Combining these formulas with the 4-way recurrence gives
$$
A_n\ge c,k_n\qquad(n\ge 60).
$$

Together with the finite check $15\le n<60$, we get

$$
\boxed{H(n)\ge A_n\ge \frac{57}{56},k_n\qquad\text{for all }n\ge 15.}
$$

So one may take $c=57/56$.

## 4. The algorithm

The function below implements exactly the recurrence above and then recursively expands the chosen construction into an actual hypergraph. It always uses exactly $n$ edges. Its running time is linear in the output size, and for $n\le 100$ it is tiny.

For this construction,
$$
|V| = A_n \ge \frac{57}{56}k_n \qquad (n\ge 15),
$$
and in particular
$$
|V| = 44 > 43 = k_{15}
$$
when $n=15$.

USER:

Great! What are the overall asymptotics of this new lower bound construction?

ASSISTANT:

Let $A_n$ be the vertex count produced by the recursive construction I gave. Then the asymptotics are

$$
A_n=\frac{13}{24},n\log_2 n+O(n)
\qquad\text{(equivalently }A_n=\frac{13}{24\ln 2},n\ln n+O(n)\text{)}.
$$

So, as a lower bound on $H(n)$,

$$
H(n)\ge A_n=\left(\frac{13}{24}+o(1)\right)n\log_2 n.
$$

The order of growth is still $n\log n$; the improvement is in the leading constant.

Here is the quick way to see it. The 4-way part of the construction has the form

$$
A_n \approx A_{n_1}+A_{n_2}+A_{n_3}+A_{n_4}+\frac{13}{12}n,
$$

where the $n_i$ are the balanced quarter-sizes, so each $n_i=n/4+O(1)$ and $\sum n_i=n$. Because of that balance,

$$
\sum_{i=1}^4 n_i\log_2 n_i
= n\log_2 n - 2n + O(1).
$$

Now plug in an ansatz $A_n\sim c,n\log_2 n$. Then

$$
c,n\log_2 n
\approx c,(n\log_2 n - 2n)+\frac{13}{12}n,
$$

so the $n$-terms must cancel, giving

$$
2c=\frac{13}{12},
\qquad c=\frac{13}{24}.
$$

That is the dominant coefficient.

For comparison, the classical binary recurrence for $k_n$ gives

$$
k_n=\frac12,n\log_2 n+O(n).
$$

Therefore this construction is asymptotically

$$
A_n=\frac{13}{12},k_n+O(n),
$$

and hence

$$
\frac{A_n}{k_n}\to \frac{13}{12}.
$$

So the real asymptotic gain is about (8.33%), even though the explicit uniform constant I extracted earlier was only $57/56$. That $57/56$ was just a conservative “valid for all $n\ge 15$” guarantee; asymptotically the construction is stronger.

A nice sanity check is along powers of four. If you recurse purely through the 4-way branch on $n=4^t$, then in fact

$$
A_{4^t}\ge \left(\frac{13}{12}t+\frac89\right)4^t+O(1)
= \frac{13}{24},4^t\log_2(4^t)+O(4^t),
$$

which makes the coefficient $\frac{13}{24}$ completely explicit.

So the headline asymptotic is:

$$
\boxed{H(n)\ge \left(\frac{13}{24}+o(1)\right)n\log_2 n
=\left(\frac{13}{12}+o(1)\right)k_n.}
$$

The lower-order term is linear and likely carries residue/digital fluctuations, so I would not expect a clean universal $+\beta n$ term for all $n$.

USER:

Take a look at this paper, which introduces the k_n construction: https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10914

Note that it's conjectured that we can do even better with the constant here. How far up can you push the constant?

ASSISTANT:

You can push it essentially all the way to the paper’s conjectured leading constant.

Brian–Larson define $H(n)$ as the largest number of vertices in a hypergraph with no isolated vertices and no partition larger than $n$. Their lower construction is the binary recurrence
$$
k_1=1,\qquad
k_n=\Big\lfloor \frac n2\Big\rfloor+k_{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}+k_{\lfloor (n+1)/2\rfloor},
$$
and Corollary 4.4 gives
$$
H(n)\ge k_n>\frac12,n\log_2 n-\frac12,n+\frac12.
$$
On the other hand, Corollary 3.8 proves
$$
H(n)< n\ln n+\gamma n+\frac12,
$$
and the paper explicitly conjectures that this upper coefficient $1$ is the right one, i.e.
$$
H(n)=n\ln n+o(n\log n).
$$
([arXiv][1])

The right generalization of the $k_n$ gadget is not just “split into more parts,” but “split into $t$ parts and use every support size with harmonic weights.” Fix $t\ge 2$, and let
$$
h_t:=1+\frac12+\cdots+\frac1t,\qquad
L_t:=\operatorname{lcm}\Bigl\{\binom{t-1}{j}:0\le j\le t-1\Bigr\}.
$$
Take $t$ recursive blocks, each with partition budget $qL_t$. For every subset $A\subseteq [t]$ of size $s\ge 2$, add
$$
\frac{qL_t}{\binom{t-1}{s-1}}
$$
new vertices supported on exactly the blocks in $A$.

Why these weights? Suppose a chosen edge-set uses exactly one edge in the blocks indexed by $I$, at most one edge in the blocks indexed by $T\supseteq I$, and at least two edges in the other blocks. Then the new vertices counted exactly once are precisely those whose support $A\subseteq T$ satisfies $|A\cap I|=1$. Their number is
$$
qL_t,|I|\sum_{j=1}^{|T|-|I|}\frac{\binom{|T|-|I|}{j}}{\binom{t-1}{j}}.
$$
Using the telescoping identity
$$
\sum_{j=0}^{m}\frac{\binom{m}{j}}{\binom{N}{j}}=\frac{N+1}{N-m+1},
$$
with $m=|T|-|I|$ and $N=t-1$, this becomes
$$
qL_t,|I|\cdot \frac{|T|-|I|}{t-(|T|-|I|)}\le qL_t(|T|-|I|).
$$
So the outer vertices use up at most the slack left after paying for the $|I|$ active recursive blocks. That makes the substitution valid.

The total number of added vertices is
$$
qL_t\sum_{s=2}^t \binom ts \frac{1}{\binom{t-1}{s-1}}
= qL_t,t\sum_{s=2}^t \frac1s
= qL_t,t(h_t-1).
$$
Therefore, for exact multiples,
$$
H(tqL_t);\ge; t,H(qL_t);+; tqL_t,(h_t-1).
$$
This is the $t$-ary analogue of the paper’s binary recurrence. The $t=2$ case is exactly the original $k_n$ construction. The $t=4$ case is exactly the 13-gadget:
one copy of every 2-subset, one of every 3-subset, and three of the 4-subset, giving $13/12$ bonus per unit capacity.

Solving that recurrence gives, for each fixed $t$,
$$
H(n)\ge \frac{h_t-1}{\log_2 t},n\log_2 n - O_t(n),
$$
equivalently
$$
H(n)\ge \frac{h_t-1}{\ln t},n\ln n - O_t(n).
$$
So the achievable coefficient is
$$
c_t^{(2)}=\frac{h_t-1}{\log_2 t}
\quad\text{in base-2 form,}
\qquad
c_t^{(\ln)}=\frac{h_t-1}{\ln t}
\quad\text{in natural-log form.}
$$

This already improves your $13/24$ constant:
$$
t=4:; \frac{13}{24}=0.54167,\qquad
t=10:; 0.58068,\qquad
t=20:; 0.60106,\qquad
t=100:; 0.63026.
$$
And as $t\to\infty$,
$$
\frac{h_t-1}{\log_2 t}\to \ln 2 \approx 0.693147,
\qquad
\frac{h_t-1}{\ln t}\to 1.
$$

So the asymptotic answer is:

$$
\boxed{H(n)\ge (\ln 2-o(1)),n\log_2 n=(1-o(1)),n\ln n.}
$$

In other words, relative to the paper’s $k_n$,
$$
k_n\sim \frac12,n\log_2 n
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
H(n)\ge (2\ln 2-o(1)),k_n,
$$
so the multiplicative constant over $k_n$ can be pushed asymptotically to
$$
\boxed{2\ln 2 \approx 1.38629.}
$$

And that is the endpoint asymptotically: the paper’s upper bound $H(n)<n\ln n+\gamma n+\tfrac12$ already rules out any natural-log coefficient bigger than $1$. ([arXiv][1])

So the strongest answer I know how to justify is: asymptotically, all the way to the conjectured constant. The binary $k_n$ construction is just the $t=2$ member of a whole harmonic $t$-ary family.

USER:

Great! Can you optimize this to produce strong-as-possible witnesses for n in the range of 15, ..., 25?

ASSISTANT:

Yes. I pushed the small-$n$ constructor with an exact outer-layer search on 5-way and 6-way compositions, plus a targeted 7-way pass. The best witnesses I found for $15\le n\le 25$ are:

| $n$ | $k_n$ | best found $|V|$ | gain | top split |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 15 | 43 | 44 | +1 | $(1,2,4,4,4)$ |
| 16 | 48 | 49 | +1 | $(2,2,2,4,6)$ |
| 17 | 50 | 52 | +2 | $(2,2,2,3,4,4)$ |
| 18 | 53 | 57 | +4 | $(2,2,2,6,6)$ |
| 19 | 56 | 60 | +4 | $(2,2,2,3,4,6)$ |
| 20 | 60 | 65 | +5 | $(4,4,4,4,4)$ |
| 21 | 63 | 69 | +6 | $(2,2,2,3,4,4,4)$ |
| 22 | 67 | 73 | +6 | $(4,4,4,4,6)$ |
| 23 | 71 | 75 | +4 | $(1,4,6,6,6)$ |
| 24 | 76 | 82 | +6 | $(4,4,4,6,6)$ |
| 25 | 79 | 85 | +6 | $(4,4,4,4,4,5)$ |

So the optimized table is
$$
(44,49,52,57,60,65,69,73,75,82,85)
\quad\text{for }n=15,\dots,25.
$$

I also saved a ready-to-run Python implementation here:

[optimized_witnesses_15_25.py](sandbox:/mnt/data/optimized_witnesses_15_25.py)

That file exposes

```python
solution(n: int) -> str
```

for $15 \le n \le 25$, returning the hypergraph in the required edge-string format.

A couple of notes on status:

* These are **best found** by the exact compositional search I ran; I am **not** claiming global optimality over all hypergraphs.
* I exhaustively checked the actual returned hypergraphs directly for $n=15,17,21$. The rest are generated by the same certified composition rule, so correctness comes from the same exact-one slack inequalities used in the search.

If you want, the next natural step is to splice this specialized table into the earlier general asymptotic constructor so one `solution$n$` uses these witnesses on $15,\dots,25$ and the harmonic/recursive fallback beyond that.

USER:

Thanks! Please write this up as a self-contained report. No need to recapitulate most of Brain-Larson, just isolate the problem about hypergraphs and prove the asymptotics for the lower bound. Include a section on how to practically generate witnesses for a given n. Please include detailed in the arguments about the construction to stand up to the scrutiny of a standard journal review process.

ASSISTANT:

I prepared the report as a polished PDF, with LaTeX source and companion witness-generation code. It starts from the Brian–Larson hypergraph extremal function $H(n)$, recalls only the problem statement and their benchmark bounds $H(n)\ge k_n$ and $H(n)<n\ln n+\gamma n+\tfrac12$, and then gives a self-contained proof that for each fixed $t$,
$$
H(n)\ge \frac{H_t-1}{\ln t},n\ln n-O_t(n),
$$
hence
$$
H(n)\ge (1-o(1)),n\ln n.
$$
It also includes a practical section on exact outer-frame optimization, recursive reconstruction, and certified witnesses for $15\le n\le25$. ([NSF Public Access Repository][1])
