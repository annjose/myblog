It has three weeks since I started the [new beginning](/post/new-beginning/), so let's review week #3. The reviews of the  past two weeks are at [Week #1 review](/post/week-in-review-week1/ "Week In Review - Week 1") and [Week #2 review](/post/week-in-review-week2/ "Week In Review - Week 2")

## What I did during the week

As usual, let' start with the goals of last week:

  1. **Complete the course *Modern JavaScript* and *Typescript* - 100% this time** ðŸŽ¯. - It turns out it is impossible to finish the Modern JavaScript course because it follows the spaced repetition model.
  2. **Improve the consistency of walking 9K steps every.single.day and do 2000m rowing three days (Tue, Thu, Sat)** ðŸ’ª - I made good progress here. Did rowing for two days - Tue and Thu. Satursday's share I will do today. Walked every day - in fact on Tuesday, I decided to walk to the piano class so that I will get the steps. After that, I went to the grocery store nearby and bought a few veggies. It was funny carrying onions and beans in a backpack along with piano lesson book and binder.
  3. **Continue to refine *The Flow* routine - move around >= 10 min every hour** ðŸš¶ðŸ‘Ÿ. - Most of the days were good, 
  4. **Play the song Perfect by Ed Sheeran on the piano - both hands** ðŸŽµðŸŽ¹ - I got the right hand properly, but the left hand was hard. But today I practiced again and I got it! It was as if it just clicked. The class also started Christmas songs - I am really excited to learn that next.
  5. **Read one book** ðŸ“š - I started a book, but did not finish it. Hoping to finish it this weekend.


An honest review of this week should start by reviewing the goals I set out at the beginning of the week. These are the goals I decided in [my last week's review](/post/week-in-review-week1/ "Week In Review - Week 1"):

  1. **Complete the courses - Learn JavaScript and Modern JavaScript** - I could not achieve this goal 100%, but completed 80% of the first course and 50% of the second one. I found that I had to do the structured course quite a bit before I can get the best value of the [Execute Program course](https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/modern-javascript). Btw, it has been a long time since I learned the fundamentals of a technology at this level of depth. This is plain HTML, JS and CSS at its core. I want to solidify my understanding of this before I learn React, Tailwind etc. I also completed the capstone project to build a simple Todo app from scratch with plain HTML, JS and CSS and stores the data in a Firebase DB ðŸš€.

  2. **Solidify the exercise routine - strength and walking** - I am happy with the progress of this goal. I did strength training by the [Julian.com Build Muscle program](https://www.julian.com/guide/muscle/intro) on all three days (Mon, Wed and Fri). I also realized that I am most productive and fresh in the mornings, whereas there is a slump in the afternoons, so I decided to start the day with learning and then do exercise in the afternoon. This followed by a bath gives me energy late into the evening. The strength exercises are simple, but hard to do because of the weights, and I really enjoy doing them - takes about 45 min to complete the routing. In terms of walking, I did more than 9K steps on 3 days. Should improve this a lot more. Need to improve the consistency of 9K steps (all 7 days).

  3. **Refine The Flow routine** - This has improved a lot from last week. I found a good rhythm of 50 min work + 10 min break, using Obsidian to take notes, Visual Code for coding, debugging and checking in code to my git repo. All of this while taking  leisure breaks to walk, play the piano or doing small chores. However, there were days when I just couldn't follow this routine - see details below in the Learnings section.

  #### Other goals/tasks done.. 
  * Completed the Silver tier for Peloton's October running challenge by walking 25 miles - for the record, I did not "run", only walked. But this is the first time this year that I got this tier. 
  * Started a Spanish lesson in Duolingo - this was the inspiration for this. Learning can be made addictive with 
  * Started a 30-day Winter cleaning - every day clean one part of the house - timeboxed to 30 min. 

## What I learned this week - the insights 

I want to try a differnt approach to share my learnings - rather than saying what I learning, let me show you how I learned.

Allow me to present three artifacts

1. Workout tracker - for the last week

2. Learning plan for the day - sometimes I track

3. Piano playing Perfect - it is nowhere close to "good", in fact you may not even recognize the song. But the deal is progress, not perfection, right? So

  What I learned this week
  - how to add a video into a blog post - added a Hugo shortcode for video and embedded it - used the shortcode by https://github.com/martignoni/hugo-video . Pretty cool. The more I learn about Hugo, the more I love it.
