It has three weeks since I started the [new beginning](/post/new-beginning/), so let's review week #3. The reviews of the  past two weeks are at [Week #1 review](/post/week-in-review-week1/ "Week In Review - Week 1") and [Week #2 review](/post/week-in-review-week2/ "Week In Review - Week 2")

## What I did during the week

As usual, let' start with the goals of last week:

  1. **Complete the course *Modern JavaScript* and *Typescript* - 100% this time** ðŸŽ¯. - It turns out it is impossible to finish the Modern JavaScript course because it follows the spaced repetition model.
  2. **Improve the consistency of walking 9K steps every.single.day and do 2000m rowing three days (Tue, Thu, Sat)** ðŸ’ª - I made good progress here. Did rowing for two days - Tue and Thu. Satursday's share I will do today. Walked every day - in fact on Tuesday, I decided to walk to the piano class so that I will get the steps. After that, I went to the grocery store nearby and bought a few veggies. It was funny carrying onions and beans in a backpack along with piano lesson book and binder.
  3. **Continue to refine *The Flow* routine - move around >= 10 min every hour** ðŸš¶ðŸ‘Ÿ. - Most of the days were good, 
  4. **Play the song Perfect by Ed Sheeran on the piano - both hands** ðŸŽµðŸŽ¹ - I got the right hand properly, but the left hand was hard. But today I practiced again and I got it! It was as if it just clicked. The class also started Christmas songs - I am really excited to learn that next.
  5. **Read one book** ðŸ“š - I started a book, but did not finish it. Hoping to finish it this weekend.


An honest review of this week should start by reviewing the goals I set out at the beginning of the week. These are the goals I decided in [my last week's review](/post/week-in-review-week1/ "Week In Review - Week 1"):

  1. **Complete the courses - Learn JavaScript and Modern JavaScript** - I could not achieve this goal 100%, but completed 80% of the first course and 50% of the second one. I found that I had to do the structured course quite a bit before I can get the best value of the [Execute Program course](https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/modern-javascript). Btw, it has been a long time since I learned the fundamentals of a technology at this level of depth. This is plain HTML, JS and CSS at its core. I want to solidify my understanding of this before I learn React, Tailwind etc. I also completed the capstone project to build a simple Todo app from scratch with plain HTML, JS and CSS and stores the data in a Firebase DB ðŸš€.

  2. **Solidify the exercise routine - strength and walking** - I am happy with the progress of this goal. I did strength training by the [Julian.com Build Muscle program](https://www.julian.com/guide/muscle/intro) on all three days (Mon, Wed and Fri). I also realized that I am most productive and fresh in the mornings, whereas there is a slump in the afternoons, so I decided to start the day with learning and then do exercise in the afternoon. This followed by a bath gives me energy late into the evening. The strength exercises are simple, but hard to do because of the weights, and I really enjoy doing them - takes about 45 min to complete the routing. In terms of walking, I did more than 9K steps on 3 days. Should improve this a lot more. Need to improve the consistency of 9K steps (all 7 days).

  3. **Refine The Flow routine** - This has improved a lot from last week. I found a good rhythm of 50 min work + 10 min break, using Obsidian to take notes, Visual Code for coding, debugging and checking in code to my git repo. All of this while taking  leisure breaks to walk, play the piano or doing small chores. However, there were days when I just couldn't follow this routine - see details below in the Learnings section.

  #### Other goals/tasks done.. 
  * Completed the Silver tier for Peloton's October running challenge by walking 25 miles - for the record, I did not "run", only walked. But this is the first time this year that I got this tier. 
  * Started a Spanish lesson in Duolingo - this was the inspiration for this. Learning can be made addictive with 
  * Started a 30-day Winter cleaning - every day clean one part of the house - timeboxed to 30 min.

## What I learned this week - the insights 

I want to try a differnt approach to share my learnings - rather than saying what I learning, let me show you how I learned.

Allow me to present three artifacts

1. Workout tracker - for the last week

2. Learning plan for the day - sometimes I track

3. Piano playing Perfect - it is nowhere close to "good", in fact you may not even recognize the song. But the deal is progress, not perfection, right? So 


* **Not all days are equal** in terms of motivation. This week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday were very productive. Tuesday was a total meh! I just couldn't focus on anything. I got so frustrated that I sent this note to my family that afternoon....

> "*Family,, I am not able to focus today :( . 
After coming back from the piano lesson (almost 3 hours back), 
I have been goofing around - having lunch, watching videos and stuff.
I am not able to sit down and study. grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr*"

* ... and they said *it's ok, you can start now*. Exactly - it's ok.
I accepted the fact that some days will go as I want, some days won't. And it's ok. That is how life is - think of what you can do next.

* **Reflect, reflect, reflect** - Practicing bullet journal reflections really helped me stay focused for the rest of the week. Ironically, I was able NOT able to do everything I planned for, but I knew what I did and what I didn't, which means I can do better the next day. And I did not use any fancy pens, Washi tapes or calligraphy - I used just a black pen and a book, that's it. The key here is that you do reflections of the day and the week, that's it.

* **Track exercises for strength training and steps** - Track the # of sets, reps in each set, the weights you are lifting in each rep and the difficulty on a scale of 1 to 10. I am tracking this in a plain notebook everyday. This week, I was doing shoulder press with 20 lbs dumbbells and I found it really difficult, especially the last two reps. While doing it, I thought it was not this difficult last week, so I looked at the notebook to last week and saw that it was difficult last week also - with difficulty 9 out of 10, and I could do only 10 reps, whereas this week I could do 12 reps. Numbers don't lie - if you track it honestly. So I should track everyday.

* Two things I learned about my two favorite tools:
  * **Visual Studio code extensions model is awesome** - I wanted to open a toml config file, searched for an extension, installed it and it gave syntax highlighting and validation - all within 2 min. The flexibility that it offers to configure the settings per project - auto-format on save, light vs. dark mode etc. is amazing. All of this I can do through the UI or through a simple change in JSON. Light-weight, blazing fast, keyboard-friendly - what more do you need from an IDE?
  * **Obsidian allows you to embed content of a page/section as inline** inside the current page. It helps you organize main content in one place and refer to them in other pages. This feature is combining [Block References](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links) and [Embedding Files](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Embedding+files). The markdown syntax for this is pretty simple - add a regular internal link and prefix it with an exclamation mark `!`. `!\[\[fileName#section^block\]\]` . (do not include the backspaces). 
  
* **I unlearned something too - deep focused work cannot be done by sitting down for long hours**. You should intersperse it with regular breaks because it helps you in three ways 1) pull you out of accidental rabbit holes, 2) force you to step back and revise/reflect what you were doing and 3) make your body be more active. My FitBit has an hourly activity reminder to take 250 steps every hour. If I haven't moved at all for the hour, it would send you a notification 10 minutes before the hour. This was super useful and forced myself to get up from the chair and walk around the house. Sometimes, when I get the notification, I would think "yeah I will walk right after finishing this small thing", and forget about it until 3 min to the hour. Then I would jump on the treadmill and ran for 2 min. See it's ok to cheat as long as it will help you not become a chair potato ðŸ™‚.

* My husband gave me a **great feedback on exercise** to do one thing that would push myself on cardio, something that will make me sweat and increase the heart-rate to the 150 range. I think he is right - even on days when I took 10K steps, I was walking on the treadmill while watching something (movie or show), so I cannot go above the speed of 3.2 mph. I can do this on the rest-days of strength training (i.e. Tue, Thu and Sat). So we thought of a few options to sweat:
  * row 2000m in 10-11 min (I haven't used our rowing machine for a while now.)
  * walk at 4mph speed for 30 min on the treadmill (this will be 2 miles)
  * run for 15 min (grrrrr.... I hate running, but let's see).


## Looking Ahead to Next Week
