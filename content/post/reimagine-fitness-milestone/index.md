A few months ago, if you had told me I’d be deadlifting 155 lbs, I would have laughed and said, "No way!" But here I am, doing it—something I never thought possible.

In a previous [post in my reimagine journey](/post/reimagine-milestone/), I talked about reframing milestones to focus on consistency rather than arbitrary goals. At the time, I was working out on my own, trying to stay active with strength training and Zone 2 walks. I was making some progress, but it was small and I felt stuck. Looking back, I realize it wasn’t a lack of effort—it was a lack of structure, consistency, and progression.

Something had to change.

## Finding a Better Approach
For most of my life, fitness felt like something I had to “get through” rather than something I could genuinely enjoy. I’d check the box, follow a plan for a while, and then lose motivation when I didn’t see results. What I needed wasn’t just another workout plan—I needed a better system.

That’s when I joined [Method3 Fitness](https://method3fitness.com) near my home.

At first, I thought it was just about getting stronger. And it was - but along the way, I realized that strength isn’t just about lifting more weight. It’s about what you do consistently and how you push your limits over time.

The difference? **Good coaching, structured progressive overload, and an incredible community.** The coaches knew when to challenge me and when to help me refine my form. And the group energy made all the difference in showing up, even on tough days.

## Breaking Through Limits
One of the biggest lessons I learned? *You are stronger than you think*.

I remember a group session where we were flipping tires. I stuck to a manageable weight for the first two rounds, but then, in front of me was an 80-lb tire. I hesitated. But the group and my coach encouraged me to try. So I did. And I turned it upside down four times!

That moment made me question how many other limits I had set for myself without even realizing it.

## Shifting the Focus from Goals to Growth
Through a mix of structured training, consistency, and small progressive increases, I saw changes that felt impossible just a few months ago. When I started in December, I could deadlift 65 lbs. By March, I lifted 155 lbs.

But the biggest shift wasn’t in the numbers — it was in my mindset, how I approached progress.

Instead of focusing on an outcome, I started focusing on small, steady improvements. I learned to trust the process—and with the right guidance and a supportive group, I started having fun! Some days, that meant lifting heavier. Other days, it meant showing up when I felt low on energy and doing what I could. And over time, it all added up.

## Beyond Strength
This shift in mindset didn’t just change the way I train—it changed the way I see challenges in general.

With better structure around nutrition, I started making choices that supported my training, not just ones that felt like temporary fixes.

And somehow, I even found myself signing up for a 5K race—something I never imagined doing. (For the record, I still hate running, so I’m speed-walking it instead! And yes, I’m fully embracing it. 😆) But with training, I’ve gone from struggling to keep pace to walking a 13-minute mile with confidence.

## Building a New Kind of Strength
I used to think progress was about hitting a specific number on the scale or reaching a big milestone. But now I see it differently. Progress is about what you show up for, over and over again.

It’s in the small wins—the extra rep, the better form, the decision to try even when you’re unsure.

Fitness isn’t something to “achieve” and be done with. It’s something you build—one step, one lift, one choice at a time. 🔥

**Indeed. You are always stronger than you think.**. 

And I’m not done yet—I still have a long way to go. 💪
