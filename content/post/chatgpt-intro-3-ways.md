I have been eager to write a blog about ChatGPT since its release last year, but was held back by the fear of facing a blank page and the challenge of starting to write. Today, I finally mustered up the courage and sat down to write. I followed my usual process by creating an outline of what I wanted to cover in the blog post.

However, I decided to do a meta experiment and see how I could utilize ChatGPT to help me write the blog. 

First, I wrote the outline of the blog - the key points and references.

Then I asked ChatGPT to write a blog post based on the outline I provided, and although the response was far from perfect, with a lot of fluff and filler words, it was still impressive to see how much it was able to expand on the topic. You can see [that version of the blog here](/post/chatgpt-fully-written-by-chatgpt/).

Afterwards, I took the time to write the blog post on my own, based on the outline, and then edited it using Obsidian and VS Code. This involved a lengthy process of finding and reading relevant articles and videos I had saved in Pocket, and summarizing the key takeaways in my own words. I previewed the post on my local Hugo instance of my blog, and finally polished it to my satisfaction. [Here is the version fully written by me](/post/chatgpt-intro/).

Finally, I turned back to ChatGPT and asked it to "improve" my full blog post. Although it wasn't able to do it in one go (most likely due to the limitations of my free version), it still generated a quite remarkable improvised version of my blog, with much fewer filler words. I am happy to have published this improved version of my blog post. [Here is the version improvised by ChatGPT](/post/chatgpt-fully-improvised-by-chatgpt/).

So here are the links to the 3 versions of the article:
* [ChatGPT Intro - written by ChatGPT using Ann's outline](/post/chatgpt-fully-written-by-chatgpt/)
* [ChatGPT Intro - fully written by Ann](/post/chatgpt-intro/)
* [ChatGPT Intro - improvised by ChatGPT, original draft by Ann](/post/chatgpt-fully-improvised-by-chatgpt/)

Ok, now I have two questions for you:
1. Which of these versions is your favorite?
2. Did I use ChatGPT for this consolidated post that you are reading now? :-)
